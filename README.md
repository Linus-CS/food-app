# FoodApp

## Description

Many people struggle to find an appropriate meal in their day-to-day lives. They wish someone would just spit out an idea for what to cook, order, or eat at a restaurant.
FoodApp is supposed to be that tool, providing a meal idea at any time of the day. In this repository, you'll find a mobile app written in React Native that tackles the problem of providing interesting meal ideas.
